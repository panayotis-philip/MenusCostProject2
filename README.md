# Android Project - Menu's Cost



### Developed an app to optimize ingredient purchasing for recipes.

This application redefines the grocery shopping experience by optimizing delivery, ordering, and modern supermarket systems. Users can input a specific recipe, build a grocery list, or select preferred brands and products. The app then suggests available options across various supermarkets based on criteria like price per quantity, quality standards, and delivery time. In addition to leveraging data from major supermarkets, the platform aims to include small businesses, offering users access to local options they might otherwise overlook. Conceived in early 2020, this idea aligns with post-pandemic trends favoring convenience, quality, and a more inclusive approach to grocery shopping.
